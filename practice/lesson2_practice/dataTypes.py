'''
Create a function that will remove duplicates from a list of vegatables using two differet data structures
Evaluate their performance and explain why one was better than the other
Notes:
    - generate a list of at least 20 items; make sure that there are at least 5 repeats
    - use computing time as a measure of performance
    - record explanations and results into dataTypes_exaplin.md (this is a markdown document; double check how to format it correctly online)
Optional:
    - Do the same task but for lists of increasing size; start with size 2 and go to 20.
    - Evaluate performance of each datatype and plot it into a bar chart using matplotlib
