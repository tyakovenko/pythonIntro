## Step 2: Perform EDA
Include relevant graphs to explain any biases; inbalances etc
## Step 3: Clean and prepare the data
## Step 4: Train 2 ML algorithms of your choosing
## Step 5: Evaluate performance of the two models
Collect basic evaluation matrics and interpret them in context. Look at the confusion matrix. Explain why one algorithm would be better than other.
## Step 6: Visualize
Create relevant graphs to explain your thinking from step 5
